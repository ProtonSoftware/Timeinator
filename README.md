# Timeinator
Welcome to the Timeinator Project Official Site.

The project was designed to help maximize personal productivity during your day.
It is not easy to remember what little actions you were supposed to do
and it is even more difficult to get them done over a limited period of time.
Here comes Timeinator with its tools to help you optimize your performance.
